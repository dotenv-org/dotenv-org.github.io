  <p class="mt-6">The privacy of your data is paramount to us. We'll only ever access your account to help you with a problem or squash a software bug. We'll never open any uploaded files unless you ask us to. We log all access to all accounts by IP address, so we can always verify that no unauthorized access has happened for as long as the logs are kept.</p>

  <h3 class="mt-6 text-left text-xl font-bold tracking-tight">Identity & Access</h3>

  <p class="mt-6">When you sign up for Dotenv, we ask for your name and email address. That's just so you can personalize your new account, and we can send you updates, or other essential information. We'll never sell your personal info to third parties, and we won't use your name in marketing statements without your permission, either.</p>
  <p class="mt-6">When you write Dotenv with a question or to ask for help, we'll keep that correspondence, and the email address, for future reference. When you browse our marketing pages, we'll track that for statistical purposes (like conversion rates and to test new designs). We also store any information you volunteer, like surveys, for as long as it makes sense.</p>
  <p class="mt-6">The only times we'll ever share your info:</p>

  <ol class="mt-6 list-decimal ml-5">
    <li>To provide products or services you've requested, with your permission.</li>
    <li>To investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Service, or as otherwise required by law.</li>
    <li>If Dotenv is acquired by or merged with another company we'll notify you well before any info about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3 class="mt-6 text-left text-xl font-bold tracking-tight">Law Enforcement</h3>
  <p class="mt-6">Dotenv won't hand your data over to law enforcement unless a court order says we have to. We reject requests from local and federal law enforcement when they seek data without a court order. And unless we're legally prevented from it, we'll always inform you when such requests are made.</p>

  <h3 class="mt-6 text-left text-xl font-bold tracking-tight">Encryption</h3>
  <p class="mt-6">All data is encrypted via SSL/TLS when transmitted from our servers to your browser. The database backups are also encrypted. Sensitive data (like your email address and all your secrets) is always encrypted while it's live in our database. It's encrypted not just at the database level. We go beyond that standard and additionally encrypt it at the programmatic level. This is beyond bank level security. We go to great lengths to secure your data at rest and in transit — you can read more about that on our security page.</p>

  <h3 class="mt-6 text-left text-xl font-bold tracking-tight">Deleted Data</h3>
  <p class="mt-6">When you cancel your account, we'll ensure that nothing is stored on our servers past 30 days. Anything you delete on your account while it's active will also be purged within 30 days (up until then it's available in the trash can).</p>

  <h3 class="mt-6 text-left text-xl font-bold tracking-tight">Changes & Questions</h3>
  <p class="mt-6">Dotenv may update this policy from time to time - we'll notify you about significant changes by email or by placing a prominent notice on our site. You can access, change or delete your personal information any time by contacting <a href="mailto:support@dotenv.org">our support team</a>.</p>

  <p class="mt-6">Questions about this privacy policy? Please <a href="mailto:support@dotenv.org">get in touch</a> and we'll be happy to answer them.</p>
