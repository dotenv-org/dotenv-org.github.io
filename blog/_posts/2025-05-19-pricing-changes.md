Starting **July 1st**, weâ€™re making changes to Dotenv.org's pricing. These updates reflect the real cost of maintaining a reliable, secure, and developer-friendly platform â€” and will help us continue supporting the ecosystem long-term.

## ðŸ“¦ Solo Plan: $5/month

The **free plan is going away**. If you're on a free Dotenv.org account, you'll need to either:

- Upgrade to the new **Solo Plan** for **$5/month**, or
- Migrate to [Dotenvx](https://github.com/dotenvx/dotenvx) â€” a free and open-source alternative that supports encrypted .env files, git sync, and more.

## ðŸ‘¥ Team Plan: $8/seat/month

For organizations, the **Team Plan** is increasing from **$4 to $8 per seat**. This applies to all existing orgs starting **August 1st**. If your team relies on Dotenv.org, this helps us scale support, security, and reliability.

## ðŸ’¡ Why the Change?

Dotenv.org has been free or inexpensive for years, but infrastructure and support costs have grown. This change allows us to:

- Keep Dotenv.org stable and secure
- Fund ongoing maintenance
- Support modern use cases with new tooling like Dotenvx

## ðŸ’¬ Questions?

We know pricing changes are disruptive. We even considered open sourcing Dotenv.org, but felt it would split the community between two overlapping tools. [Dotenvx](https://github.com/dotenvx/dotenvx) is better positioned to serve developers long-term â€” it's open-source, doesn't require any backend infrastructure, and works anywhere.

If you have questions or need help transitioning to Dotenvx, reach out â€” we're happy to help. Migrating is straightforward.

Thanks for using Dotenv all these years. We're excited about what comes next.
