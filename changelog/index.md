## Pricing Changes

Starting July 1st, Dotenv.org is removing its free plan and updating pricing. The new **Solo Plan** will cost $5/month, and Team Plan pricing is increasing from **$4 to $8 per seat**. If you're currently on a free plan, you'll need to upgrade or migrate to [Dotenvx](https://github.com/dotenvx/dotenvx), our open-source alternative.

## Full Edit mode

Now you can fully edit your `.env` files from the UI. It's riskier than editing individual keys, but sometimes you just want to fully paste in a pre-existing `.env` file. Use with care.

## Golang .env.vault support

If you're a Golang developer you can now use `.env.vault` files with your deployments.

Install godotenvvault:

```bash
go get github.com/dotenv-org/godotenvvault
```

And as early as possible in your application, import and configure it:

```golang
package main

import (
    "log"
    "os"

    "github.com/dotenv-org/godotenvvault"
)

func main() {
  err := godotenvvault.Load()
  if err != nil {
    log.Fatal("Error loading .env file")
  }

  s3Bucket := os.Getenv("S3_BUCKET")
  secretKey := os.Getenv("SECRET_KEY")

  // now do something with s3 or whatever
}
```

## NodeJS .env.vault support

[dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv/tree/v16.1.0-rc1) is getting first-class native support for decrypting .env.vault files.

It's currently released as an RC candidate. Once released, [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) will be deprecated.

## dotenv-vault local commands

You can now run the following three commands to generate your own **.env.vault** file, without relying on dotenv.org to do it for. It works by managing all your secrets completely locally.

* npx dotenv-vault local build
* npx dotenv-vault local decrypt
* npx dotenv-vault local keys

Upgrade to [dotenv-vault@1.19.0](https://github.com/dotenv-org/dotenv-vault/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1190-2023-04-06) to use them. You can read more about these commands [here](https://github.com/dotenv-org/dotenv-vault#local-build).

## New Website

We've redesigned the www site to better describe the benefits of using **dotenv-vault**.

Our goal is toward better explaining the innovation around **.env.vault** and how it benefits developers, dev ops teams, and CSOs.

## GitHub Add-on

Auto-build your encrypted .env.vault file on each environment change.

It can become a chore to run `npx dotenv-vault build` each time you are ready to deploy new secret changes. Let GitHub do it for you with this [automation add-on](https://www.dotenv.org/docs/addons/github).

## DOTENV_KEY rotation for dotenv-vault-rails

Added support for rotating <strong>DOTENV_KEY</strong> in [dotenv-vault-rails](https://github.com/dotenv-org/dotenv-vault-ruby).

Update to <strong>0.10.0</strong> or greater to support key rotation in Ruby and Rails.

[Pull Request](https://github.com/dotenv-org/dotenv-vault-ruby/pull/2)

## Smarter Encrypted Builds

Now, `npx dotenv-vault build` regenerates itself only if there are changes.

This increases security and improves DX.

It improves security by minimizing the chance of a nonce collision - which would expose your DOTENV_KEY. (Please note this is still incredibly rare. You would have to rebuild your .env.vault file a few billion times before this might occur. Nonetheless, we prefer to minimize the possibility.)

It improves DX because it follows the principle of least surprise. You will see your .env.vault file change only after you've changed your values.

## python-dotenv-vault further extended

[python-dotenv-vault](https://github.com/dotenv-org/python-dotenv-vault) has extended support for:

* [Comma separated DOTENV_KEY capability](https://github.com/dotenv-org/python-dotenv-vault/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#020) (for use with key rotation)
* [Multiple environment support](https://github.com/dotenv-org/python-dotenv-vault/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#011) 

These changes put python-dotenv-vault at parity with [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv).

<time datetime="2022-10-30">2022-10-30</time>
## python-dotenv-vault

Decryption support for .env.vault files has been added to Python. If you're using [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/), [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), or plain ol' Python, you can use Dotenv Vault with it.

Check it out at [python-dotenv-vault](https://github.com/dotenv-org/python-dotenv-vault) and tell your Python friends.

## Rotate Dotenv Key

Rotate your <strong>DOTENV_KEY</strong> with the following command:

```
$ npx dotenv-vault rotatekey production
```

![](/assets/img/cloudinary/rotatekeys_axduqs.gif)

Then:

1. Update DOTENV_KEY by comma-appending the new value
2. Rebuild and deploy your .env.vault file
3. Update DOTENV_KEY by removing the old value

[See docs](/docs/dotenv-vault/rotatekey) for more information. Supported for [NodeJS](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) library. [Ruby](https://github.com/dotenv-org/dotenv-vault-ruby) and [Python](https://github.com/dotenv-org/dotenv-vault-python) support coming soon.

<time datetime="2022-10-22">2022-10-22</time>
## New Integrations

* [Astro](https://www.dotenv.org/docs/integrations/netlify/astro)
* [Fly.io](https://www.dotenv.org/docs/integrations/fly/express)
* [Railway](https://www.dotenv.org/docs/integrations/railway/nodejs.html)
* [Remix](https://www.dotenv.org/docs/integrations/github/actions-remix)

## Spam Protection with Turnstile

We swapped our honeypot spam protection mechanism for [Cloudflare Turnstile](https://blog.cloudflare.com/turnstile-private-captcha-alternative/). It is more reliable at catching spam and the experience is still good ‚Äì no annoying captchas identifying traffic signs.

<time datetime="2022-10-06">2022-10-06</time>
## New Docs

We have updated our [/docs](/docs) site. It's built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). This way we've been able to make it [public on GitHub](https://github.com/dotenv-org/www) ‚Äì making it easy to edit.

<time datetime="2022-10-02">2022-10-02</time>
## Integrate Everywhere

Integrate Everywhere‚Ñ¢ is our new approach to integrations. It works everywhere you can deploy your code. No more brittle integrations coordinating API calls. Instead, build and encrypt your local .env.vault file, commit it to code, and deploy. There's nothing else like it.

```
$ npx dotenv-vault build
$ git commit -am "Add .env.vault"
$ git push
```

<time datetime="2022-05-02">2022-05-02</time>
## Unlimited Projects

You can now create an unlimited amount of projects.

* Create an unlimited amount of projects
* Create an unlimited amount of secrets per project
* Access those secrets using [dotenv-vault](/install)

![](/assets/img/changelog/unlimited-projects.png)

<time datetime="2022-04-02">2022-04-02</time>
## Multiple Environments

Manage your secrets across multiple environments.

* Develompent, ci, staging, and production environments
* Manage secrets across multiple environments through both the ui and [dotenv-vault](/install)
